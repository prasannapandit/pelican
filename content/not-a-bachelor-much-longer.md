If you read that title and thought that some hare-brained girl with
rather poor judgement has agreed to marry me, then you are greatly
mistaken. This post is just an announcement of my post-graduate study
plans.

From early-August this year, I shall be quitting my cushy and
comfortable job in the corporate world (I have a very nice chair at
work) and will be jumping head-first into the crazy world of classrooms,
labs and research at the [Indian Institute of Science,
Bangalore](http://www.iisc.ernet.in/). It is a Masters-by-Research
programme called
[MSc(Engg)](http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/admissions/msc-phd.htm) at the
[Supercomputer Education and Research
Centre](http://www.serc.iisc.ernet.in/index.htm) at IISc. The last few
months have been
[crazy](http://twitter.com/prasannapandit/status/10506252353) and I am
happy to have made it. I will be going back to college after a full
three years, so wish me luck!

**PS:**

1\. A detailed post of my past three months' adventure will follow.
Hopefully.

2\. On a completely unrelated note, I am now the uncle of a baby boy!
He's tiny and cute and much like his uncle, words like "extreme
handsomeness" are being used to describe him (I am serious! Why are you
laughing?).  So, now that I have been "uncleified",  I guess I am no
longer allowed to snarl at random kids on the street who call me
"uncle". Sigh.
