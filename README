Workflow for pubishing the site:

make publish #to generate output
make serve #to view the site on localhost:8000/
git add . #Add files
git commit -m "Comment" 
git push origin master #Git push to pelican repo on github
make github #Push the generated site to prasannapandit.github.io

To change theme, set THEME variable in pelicanconf.py to point to theme path (checked out from
pelican-themes repo).
